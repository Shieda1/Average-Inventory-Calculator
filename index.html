    What is the average inventory?<br>
    The average inventory is a measurement of the number of a specific product or set of products over two or more time periods. The average inventory is the mean of inventory during a specific period of time.<br>
    How to calculate average inventory?<br>
    To calculate average inventory you should use the following formula:<br>
    average inventory = (current inventory + previous inventory) / number of periods<br>
    Example: company x's inventory for september, october and november is $416,000, $256,000 and $534,000, calculate the average inventory?<br>
    using the average inventory formula the answer will be like this:<br>
    average inventory = (current inventory + previous inventory) / number of periods<br>
    average inventory = ($416,000 + $256,000 + $534,000) / 3<br>
    average inventory = $402,000<br>
    Why use average inventory?<br>
    Companies use the average inventory to find out how fast they can turn inventory into sales. It is also used to give an overview for a specific period of time.<br>
